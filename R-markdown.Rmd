## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# homework

## challenge 1

#### loading string manipulation package
library(stringr)

#### breaking sentence into substrings using a blank space as a separator
split_quote <- str_split("Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.", " ")

split_quote

#### breaking sentence into substrings using a blank space as a separator and removing punctuation using gsub
split_no_punct <- str_split(gsub("[[:punct:]]","","Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."), " ")

split_no_punct

## challenge 2

#### creating matrix of sequence from 1-80 with 8 rows and 10 columns, populating matrix by columns
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)

m

#### storing columns 2, 3, and 6 of the matrix
x <- m[ ,c(2,3,6)]

x

#### storing rows 6 and 8 of the matrix
x <- m[c(6,8), ]

x

#### storing rows 2 through 6 and columns 2 through 9 of the matrix
x <- m[c(2:6),c(2:9)]

x

## challenge 3

#### creating array containing the sequence from 400 to 1 with 5, 5, 4, and 4 as the 1st, 2nd etc. dimensions
a <- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))

a

#### storing the number at position 1, 1, 1, 2 in a
y <- a[1, 1, 1, 2]

### returns [1] 300

y

#### storing the set of numbers that fit the combined criteria of being in row 2, column 3, and "stack" 2, regardless of the 4th dimension in a. I visualize this as a rubik's cube in which all the numbers change each minute, so we are storing all the numbers that, over time, have occupied the spot 2, 3, 2
z <- a[2, 3, 2, ]

### returns [1] 364 264 164  64

z

#### storing the intersection of rows 1-5, columns 1-5, stack 3, and "time" 3 in a
q <- a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]

### returns           [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
### [1,]  150  145  140  135  130
### [2,]  149  144  139  134  129
### [3,]  148  143  138  133  128
### [4,]  147  142  137  132  127
### [5,]  146  141  136  131  126

q

## challenge 4

#### building a set of nested lists to represent a phylogeny, clades at the lowest level that are not themselves lists are strings
Platyrrhini <- list("Cebidae","Atelidae","Pitheciidae")

Catarrhini <- list("Cercopithecidae","Hylobatidae","Hominidae")

Anthropoidea <- list(Platyrrhini,Catarrhini)

Tarsioidea <- list("Tarsiidae")

Lorisoidea <- list("Lorisidae","Galagidae")

Lemuroidea <- list("Cheirogaleidae","Lepilemuridae","Indriidae","Lemuridae","Daubentoniidae")

Haplorhini <- list(Anthropoidea,Tarsioidea)

Strepsirhini <- list(Lorisoidea,Lemuroidea)

Primates <- list(Haplorhini,Strepsirhini)

Primates

## challenge 5

#### building a matrix with 5 rows and 3 columns populated by row
challenge_m <- matrix(data = c(3, 0, 1 ,23, 1, 2, 33, 1, 1, 42, 0, 1, 41, 0, 2), nrow = 5, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

#### converting above matrix to a data frame
challenge_df <- data.frame(challenge_m)

challenge_df

#### converting 0 and 1 values in column 2 to boolean logic terms
challenge_df[ ,2] <- as.logical(challenge_df[ ,2])

challenge_df

#### converting numerical values in column 3 to factors
challenge_df[ ,3] <- as.factor(challenge_df[ ,3])

challenge_df

#### showing classes of items in the dataframe
str(challenge_df)
